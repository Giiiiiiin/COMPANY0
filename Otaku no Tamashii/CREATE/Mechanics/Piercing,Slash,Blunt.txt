Slash strong against: cloth, padding, and no armour

Piercing strong against: chain links, padding, and cloth; in skilled hands it's good against stronger armours while aiming for weak points.

Blunt\strike strong against: stronger armours, but not as good against thick padding.

Depending on what it is, ranged weapons can be either blunt or piercing.

I'm likely missing some other things those types are strong against, but you can apply these basics to not only armour wearing beings, but to various creatures\monsters. Perhaps a monster has a lot of blubber\fat that acts as a shock absorber, thus making it strong against blunt attacks; making maces and warhammers ineffective against it.

Scales might be weak against blunt force or piercing, depending on how the scales are set on the creature; blunt force would cause damage to internal organs without breaking the skin, where as piercing weapons might be used (in trained hands) to attack weak spots.
