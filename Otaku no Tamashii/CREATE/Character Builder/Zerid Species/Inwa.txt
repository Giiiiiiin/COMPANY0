This is my little assistant, Uw. He’s from a race called Inwa, which all look very alike, so don’t confuse my Uw with Adeira’s Inwa. They’re the ideal familiars that researchers can have since they highly adaptable and tenacious. They have almost no fighting prowess but extremely hard to kill, especially when they become familiars. The only way to kill them is strike their hearts once they run out of mana, which they never use even when they essentially die. Meaning, they can only die to someone with the ability to drain their mana. Their survivability spikes when they’re contracted to others since their master serves as an extension of their mana pool, and even if the event occurs that their cores are pierced when both the Inwa and master have no mana, as long as the master is alive, they can return to them and regenerate their bodies.


Yes. Their bodies have a high concentration of control magic, which allows them to be this way. They can easily shrink any solids they consume but they have a harder time dealing with liquids and gases. If you’re afraid of getting dissolved by their gastric juices, then you’d be glad to hear that they can control their production at will. They don’t produce them when transporting and do when eating. The only thing to keep in mind is to wait for an hour after feeding them before storing items to let their juices dissolve.
