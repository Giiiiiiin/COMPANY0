Contract between two people with mana, usually between Zeldians
	Requires body samples from both participants. Start ritual:

“Affix the souls, attach the bodies; bridge our fates.”
     --Summon Spirit Symbol. To continue, place samples on diamond and both participants stand on the ends of the half-arc

“Revel, the pair that appends for their weakness. Behold, this binding ritual to the God of Sky, Lightning, and Thunder. Embody our will, almighty elements of the universe!”
     --turn to crescent moon, summon two circles and line, move diamond to center of line.

“Hear me, the Master, and her, the servant!”
     --diamond consumes two circles and line, moves under the servant and place the blood before them. Crescent spins until diamond fixes and centers on it with Master in the center of it.

“Our silent voices speak the truth, our wills that form the bond, let the chalice of promise be filled with our hearts!”
     --elements accumulate into the samples

“Listen to our voiceless souls, the incarnation of our pure wills!”
     --samples drop to the ground and coat the symbols

“Forge the covenant between our pure souls!”
     --crescent moon and diamond turn to particles. master absorbs crescent and servant absorbs diamond. resolve
