Spells that use spirit power to compress chanting time and, if done well, apply other spells to it.

“Hmm, let’s say that we have a normal mid-tier spell that can make a certain effect happen and describe this effect as ‘explosive.’ Going through the method of creating spells, spirit power can be used, or specifically, symbols, to craft a spell that incorporates other spells into the new spell. This new spell is called a Spirit Spell. It uses the caster’s spirit power along with mana. This certain spirit spell has the power to produce the effects of the earlier spell we talked about in addition to other effects.”

“—It would be like casting two spells at the same time? That’s right. It creates a symbol out of the words in a chant to address the activation of another spell. Just like what I said earlier, the normal spell could be described as ‘explosive.’ A word or phrase inside of the spirit spell’s chant will be used to embody this spell, activating it along with the activation of the spirit spell. Alternatively, it can also be used in a single spell. Let’s say you have a high-tier spell and its requirements and grammar can be manipulated. You can turn that spell into a spirit spell by shortening phrases into words, making it seem like a mid-tier spell.”
