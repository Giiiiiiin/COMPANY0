A concentrated substance that is created through the wear of an ARC-Mana core. It is very sensitive and can only survive when it is sealed away from other power sources such as mana and spirit power. If it is exposed, it turns to a plain melted substance (transparent) that has no use.
Conversely, when it makes contact with a massive amount of mana at a single time, typically exposed mana, it produces a powerful spark of energy. If it is unfiltered, the energy will only cause an explosion. But, if used properly, it can empower the mana that was used to spark its power.
