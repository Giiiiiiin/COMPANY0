Contract between spirits
	Requires the cores to be in close proximity, usually solved by manifesting weapons and placing their souls there. Then, both chant:

“I am you. You are me. Our souls are one being in the form of two. I am He who Holds, grasp that carries your departure, grasp that releases your arrival. Ruler of Tophet, witness our pledge.”

“I am <Name>. Hear my oath. <Oath>. Betrayal be bane, loyalty be boon.”

“Voice be heard, words be honored, soul be fettered. I am <Name?, and I place my soul with this pledge.”
