Magic is a phenomenon derived from the element ingression. There are many types of magic, some of them are: 
fire magic, wind magic, and teleportation magic.

Magic enables the ability to control, create, and shape elements or, in other words, absolute control over
the element. By using mana, you will receive temporary control over the chosen element/s. Proportional to 
the amount of mana you use, you will receive access to any of the 11 elements.
