O Fire, protect me with your flare, become my mantle. Cloak me like the heavenly sun. Sun's Protection!

	Sun's Protection is continuous magic that lets out a burst of flame in a five-second interval 
	for as long as the user wants to, as long as the user has mana to sustain it. It busted flame 
	around the user like the flaming sun and protected it from any nearby enemies.
