O Fire, become my sword, become my shield. Let me wield your burning flame to cut down my adversaries. 
Knight Spell, Fire Magic!
	
	Knight Spell is a magic that creates a temporary blade to cover one of the user's limbs and a 
	temporary invisible shield that blocked any attack that it could. In Yuu's situation, she used 
	fire magic so the blade that covered her right arm and the temporary shield used fire.
