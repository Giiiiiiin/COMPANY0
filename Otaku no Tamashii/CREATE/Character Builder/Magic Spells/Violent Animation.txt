"A"

Mid-tier nature magic that spreads a red smoke that turns nearby flora to come to life and
agress on the caster's targets. If there are none and they are not stopped by the caster,
they will kill anything nearby with life, plants excluded. This only lasts until either the
caster cuts off the magic or runs out of mana.
