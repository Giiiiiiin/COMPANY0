An attack that uses control magic to convert energy/pressure into sound-imbued magic that runs throughout the body of a target
and solidifies the magic to restrict its movement. A larger target requires more energy. Attempting this attack on a large
target with only little energy will do nothing as there is either an insufficient amount of energy to cover the whole target's
body or the target is too powerful to be held by the initial amount of energy.
