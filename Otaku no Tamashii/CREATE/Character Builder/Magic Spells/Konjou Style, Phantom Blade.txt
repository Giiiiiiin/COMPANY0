A Spirit Spell

A technique that uses dark magic to spread a cloud with sense disruption in the area. Dulling the perception of those that touch it, and increasing the quality and effeciency of the user's light magic. It is followed by multiple casts of an advanced version of Ephermal Clone imbued with a small amount of spirit magic, allowing multiple clones to move on their own with the caster's will to guide them.
