An attack that collects all the wind pressure from using flash strike and releasing it all as a follow up attack after
swinging a weapon. Imitating a quick double slash where the second slash can be manipulated as a powerful but blunt strike
that prioritizes crowd control over damage or a sharp pressurized strike that prioritizes damage over crowd control.
