It is a function that uses a blood gem security system to assign one or more owners to a magic item so that only they will 
be able to use it. It requires blood and some apocrologic tools to register and remove an owner from an item. And when using 
it, the item collects a small blood sample from the holder. If the blood signature doesn’t match, it will not work. Since 
blood gems also take in the owner’s mana along with the blood, this prevents any security breaches from blood relatives.
