Name derived from the Zeldian meaniing Resonate Link

At first appearance, it is a stone with wavy pattern but possesses a smooth texture. 
When mana is applied to it, its dark shades will glow pink and purple and begin shaking.
If the stone goes away from the south, the shaking will become stronger.
If the stone gets closer to the south, the shaking will begin to weaken.
The cause of the shaking is the amount of mana the stone is consuming in order to maintain connection to the largest throng of
Ailak Stone (The southmost island, Frxal, meaning Heart).

Ailak Stones can be synthesized with other Ailak stones so that their resonation will center upon the main ailak stone.
