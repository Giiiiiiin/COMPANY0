Enemy Di Manes - Hiroto

Enemy Di Manes' goal is to use Chouka's soul to power his spirit altar, his own unique skill to forecully take ownership of
a piece of the 6th Hero's weapon. His specialty, Spirit Thief, is a technique that allows him to create a pseudo-soul inside 
objects and take ownership of said object using his soul. In situations where the object already has a soul, like a weapon
of a spirited soul, he must overpower it by having superior spirit power and skill to penetrate its defences, otherwise it
will not work. Moreover, he has the power to forcefully make a spirit rampage as they are almost certain to be overpowered.

By having the 6th Hero's weapon, he will stab the 6th Hero and take revenge on the God that ordered Yuuki's death.

Most of his organization is loyal to him as they also want the death of the God that killed their previous ruler, Hades.
The arc ends with the Di Mane discovering Masayoshi's existance within Kuro Yaiba and a stab through the core that connects
him with Yuuki's Soul Fragment, convincing him to back down and ally with Ryosei and the other Di Manes.
