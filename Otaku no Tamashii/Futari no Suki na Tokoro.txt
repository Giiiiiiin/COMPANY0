Senkyo likes her...
   Gap Moe (how she treats him differently from others)
   Fun conversations and a cheerful atmosphere
   general presence lightens him up
   reactions when she gets teased is cute
   how assertive she can be when serious
   how she relies on him so much to the point where he'd like to protect her

Yuu
   Reliable
   Kind
   Always protects promises
   Cool
   Looks up to him since he can continue even without his parents
   Easy to talk to
   Relates with him
   Fun to be with
   Loyal to the point where he doesn't let go of her
